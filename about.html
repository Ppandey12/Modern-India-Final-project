        <p>Prior to 1991, capital flows to India predominately consisted of aid flows, commercial borrowings, and
            nonresident Indian deposits. Direct investment was restricted, foreign portfolio
            investment was channeled almost exclusively into a small number of public sector bond issues, and foreign
            equity holdings in Indian companies were not permitted.</p>
